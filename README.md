# VR-ISS-Simulator
This is my first attempt at building for VR.

I want to create a simulator using the ISS model provided from Nasa 3D resources

I Have set this up using Unity and openVR to build cross platform.

I am hoping to model the potential use of VR for satellite inspection and in the future robot motion planning with the candarm.

I have updated the model to sperate the arm pieces and now need to add joins

also need to add in movement using controllers. am testing VRTK for this.
